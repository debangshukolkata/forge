## Lift and shadow

A button that rises and gets a softer, wider shadow on hover. The safest hover for a primary button.

Markup:

```html
<button class="mi-btn-lift-shadow">Continue</button>
```

Import the stylesheet once, after index.css: `import "./motion-micro.css"` (it holds all forty micro-interactions; keep the classes you use). It reads the project's tokens with fallbacks and stops under `prefers-reduced-motion`; do not rely on motion alone to say something (show a text state too).
